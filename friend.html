<br>classmates during diploma, but also my roomates, 
<br>groupmates, and everything. They are always being 
<br>there for me through thick and thin :')

Not to forget, this is Najiha, my classmate & groupmate during 
<br>this degree. We never met, didn't know each other in real life. 
<br>But she helped me a lot during this odl. I am really grateful
<br>to know such a good friend during this difficult time.
