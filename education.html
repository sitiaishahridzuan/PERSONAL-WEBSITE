<CENTER> <FONT SIZE="5"COLOR="BLACK" FACE="INK FREE"> I started my primary education at Sekolah Kebangsaan Tanjong Mas and later
<br> transferred to Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Dato Perdana in Bachok for secondary school.
<BR><BR>
Previously, I am a graduate from UiTM Machang, where I completed my Diploma in Office Management & Technology.
And, proud to tell that I managed to obtain the ANC (Anugerah Naib Canselor) during my diploma, Alhamdulillah. Next for my degree, amin insyaAllah!
<BR><BR>
Since my school days, I have been quite passionate about calculation subject and always wanted to be a Financial Officer in a bank.
So, that's the big why I changed from my previous diploma course and decided to further my Degree in Finance. </CENTER>
